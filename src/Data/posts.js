    title: "The Perfect Lie",
    content:
      "From the outside, the Ajayi family was flawless. A mansion with golden gates. A father whose suits cost more than a teacher’s salary. A mother so elegant, she turned heads at every PTA meeting. And Tomiwa, a.k.a Tomy to friends and loved ones, the adored only son, living a dream life most boys envied. But behind the polished front door, chaos brewed.",

    title: "The Cracks Begin",
    content:
      "Tomy was eight when the world shifted. His father, once a titan in the oil industry, began drinking. First on weekends. Then on days he skipped work. The man who once tucked him in with bedtime stories now stumbled into the house, singing offbeat tunes and reeking of gin. His mother, once radiant, grew tired. Tired of pretending. Tired of carrying everything. She became sharp, loud, unpredictable. Arguments replaced laughter. Shards of glass replaced family dinners. And yet, when Dad sobered up, he morphed back into Mr. Perfect — doting, apologetic, generous. He took them shopping. Planned surprise trips. Sent Mum roses. The world saw the highlight reel. No one saw Tomy disappearing.",

    title: "Silent Scars",
    content:
      "No one noticed the silence that wrapped around Tomy like a straitjacket. Not when he came home with bruises. Not when the maid started locking the door behind her. Not when he stopped speaking in full sentences. They gave him what they thought was love — gifts, vacations, ice cream trucks on Saturdays. They didn’t know they were feeding a starving boy candy instead of care. Last week, he won an award at school. His parents didn’t even know he entered a competition.",

    title: "From Golden Boy to Ghost",
    content:
      "By 16, Tomy had perfected his masks. By 18, he traded innocence for escape — drugs, parties, and sex. He didn’t feel alive unless he was almost dead. His fame on campus wasn’t academic. Girls feared and adored him. Stories circulated — orgies, threesomes, blackout nights. Two near-fatal encounters with girls at his mother’s university — covered up before daylight. They called him 'mysterious.' He called it pain.",

    title: "Then Came Gina",
    content:
      "It was just another lecture. Noisy, crowded, forgettable. Until he saw her. Gina. She wasn’t flashy. She didn’t dress for attention. But she glowed with something rare — peace. Something sacred. Her laugh was pure, her confidence gentle. She spoke with conviction. She believed in God. She was sexy in a way Tomy didn’t know how to defile. He wanted her. But not to conquer. He wanted to heal.",

    title: "A Love That Held a Mirror",
    content:
      "Gina didn’t judge. She asked. She listened. She brought him books. Invited him to church. Gave him space, and yet somehow stayed close enough for him to feel. He tried to push her away. She stayed. He ghosted her for three weeks. She brought soup when he got sick. And then one night, after a bender that nearly ended him, he collapsed on the floor of his hostel, sobbing, drunk, broken. She sat beside him. Held his face. Whispered: 'Tomiwa… You are not what they did to you.' That broke him more than the abuse ever did.",

      "Redemption wasn’t glamorous. He went to therapy. He told his parents everything. His dad cried. His mother collapsed. For the first time, they became a real family — flawed, raw, and open. He apologized to girls he could reach. He started writing. Painting. Going on walks instead of parties. And slowly, he found God. Not religion. Not shame. Just… grace.",

      "He wasn’t perfect. But he was present. And with Gina by his side, not as a savior, but a witness, Tomy took the first real steps toward a life he thought he’d never deserve. Because in the end, it wasn’t love that saved him. It was being seen. To be continued…",
